# Mat2CST
CST STUDIO SUITE [1] is a powerful electromagnetic simulation software which has recently updated with multiphysics sovlers. Integrating this software to ubiquitous MATLAB [2] will increase the functionality of the CST many fold. Mat2CST is an MATLAB toolbox developed to automate the CST i.e to control CST directly from MATLAB without using any intermediate VBA bas file. CST has many different solvers and currently Mat2CST toolbox can be used to control most of the features of the eigenmode solver. In future, collobaration from different users it is planned to include other solvers too. If you are interested in collaboration, please contact : gowrishankar.hallilingaiah@uni-rostock.de 

## Software and the compatible versions
Foloowing softwares and versions ae supported by this toolbox. 
MATLAB 2017A
CST STUDIO 2017
Note: There is no gaurantee that the Mat2CST toolbox would work in lower or higher versions of the above software. However, small changes might be required to make it work.
